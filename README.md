# meetomes

In this project, we recorded and transcribed research meetings from an interdisciplinary research team.
To the transcripts, we applied conversation analysis to identify which actions team members took during the meeting (i.e. posing a question, delegating tasks, etc.).
We merged these actions into interactional roles. Each interactional role was characterized by a set of actions that might foster translation.
We aimed to analyze how the relative occurrence of role-specific (chair, clarifying, etc.) actions impacted the connectome of the meeting (the meetome).
Therefore, we performed correlations and constructed linear mixed models to determine the relationship between the relative occurrence of role-specific actions, network measures and meeting evaluations.
